# CryptoClustering

This project focuses on clustering cryptocurrencies using unsupervised machine learning techniques. I scaled the data and used KMeans to group cryptocurrencies by similarities. The elbow method was used to determine the ideal number of clusters. Finally, PCA was implemented to compare clustering results to the original data.
